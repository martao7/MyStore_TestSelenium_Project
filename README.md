Test automation of a website with IntelliJ IDEA and the Selenium Webdriver in JavaScript:
https://prod-kurs.coderslab.pl/index.php

This project is about creating a test automation for an online shop. The aim of the software testing was to check whether the website user could register (create an account) and then log in without any problems. 
Furthermore, the usability and use of the online shop should be ensured from the product view and selection to the check-out process including payment and delivery options.

Using the IntelliJ IDEA development environment and the Selenium Webdriver, 
I create automated tests in JavaScript that I run in the Google Chrome browser. 
For describing individual features, I use Cucumber and Gherkin. The tests consist of page object patterns.
